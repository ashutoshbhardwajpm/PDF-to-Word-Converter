# PDF-to-Word Converter

PDF-to-Word Converter is a Python GUI application that allows users to convert PDF files into editable Word documents.  
The application provides a simple interface where users can select a PDF file and choose the destination folder to save the converted Word file.  
It does not save files automatically to fixed locations, giving full control to the user.

## Features
- Converts PDF files to Word (.docx) format.
- GUI interface for easy file selection and destination choice.
- Supports multiple PDFs (if extended).
- Ensures the layout and text of the original PDF is preserved as much as possible.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python GUI development with Tkinter.
- File handling and path selection.
- Working with PDF and Word document libraries (e.g., `pdf2docx` or similar).
- User-centric interface design.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python file to launch the application.
2. Click "Browse" to select the PDF file.
3. Choose the destination folder where you want the Word file saved.
4. Click "Convert" to generate the Word document.
5. Access the converted file in the selected folder.

This project was created as a practical exercise to learn Python GUI programming while building a functional PDF utility tool.
